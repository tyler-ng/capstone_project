</div><p>Learn about how Guelph-Wellington Paramedic Service collects, uses, and discloses your personal health information.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="personal-health-information-protection-act-2004"></span>Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Guelph-Wellington Paramedic Service provides urgent medical care and transportation services to sick or injured individuals and also operates a Community Paramedicine Program that provides services to support individuals to live well in their own homes.</p>
<p>As an ambulance service operating under the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a19">Ambulance Act, R.S.O. 1990</a>, Guelph-Wellington Paramedic Service is a “health information custodian” subject to the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03">Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 </a>(PHIPA) which governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health information.</p>
<p>PHIPA establishes rules regarding your personal health information and provides you with certain rights.</p>
<h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="collection-use-and-disclosure-of-your-personal-health-information"></span>Collection, use, and disclosure of your personal health information<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>Guelph-Wellington Paramedic Service collects, uses, and discloses the following personal health information to provide you with health care services and programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>if police or fire services arrive at an incident scene first, paramedics may collect information from them to better understand the situation</li>
<li>if you are unconscious or unable to provide information, paramedics may collect information indirectly from individuals such as friends or witnesses that are able to provide details related to your condition</li>
<li>if you are a participant in the Community Paramedicine Program, information about you may be collected from your family members or other health care providers to better understand your needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Paramedics may also collect personal health information about you from other sources with your consent or as permitted or required by law. For example, shared electronic systems or provincial data repositories.</p>
<p>Guelph-Wellington Paramedic Service uses and discloses your personal health information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide you with care and service by paramedics and the health care system</li>
<li>process payments for your treatment and care</li>
<li>comply with legal and regulatory requirements</li>

<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>management</li>

<li>decision making</li>
<li>compiling statistics</li>
